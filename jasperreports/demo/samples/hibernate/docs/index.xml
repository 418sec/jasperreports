<b>Data Sources and Report Queries</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Report generation relies on creating report templates, compiling and filling them with data. 
At fill time, the data necessary to populate the compiled report should be provided to the 
engine. Usually the engine expects to receive these data already stored in a 
<api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JRDataSource.html">JRDataSource</api> object as the 
report data source (see the <a href="../datasource/index.html">Data Source</a> sample for 
a complete reference). 
<br/>
There are situations when creating from scratch a filled 
<api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JRDataSource.html">JRDataSource</api> 
object is quite impossible (for instance, data are stored in relational databases with thousands 
of records, or in huge XML files. In this case, automatic generation of filled 
<api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JRDataSource.html">JRDataSource</api> 
objects is required.
<br/>
One possibility is to instruct the engine how to retrieve the necessary data and then create a 
related <api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JRDataSource.html">JRDataSource</api>. 
The most common way to get relevant data is to filter them by running a query and picking up 
filtered data from the data container. For more information about report queries, please consult the 
<a href="../query/index.html">Query</a> sample.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Query Executers</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Query executers are part of the JasperReports API dedicated to collect and organize data into 
<api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JRDataSource.html">JRDataSource</api> objects used by the 
engine at report filling time.
<br/>
A query executer should be able to perform three main tasks, exposed by the 
<api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/query/JRQueryExecuter.html">JRQueryExecuter</api> interface:
<ul>
<li>To execute queries and organize retrieved data into a 
<api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JRDataSource.html">JRDataSource</api> implementation. 
This happens when the <code>createDatasource()</code> is called.</li>
<li>To cancel a running query, if the user decides to interrupt that query. For doing this, 
the <code>cancelQuery()</code> method should be called.</li>
<li>To close resources kept open during the data source iteration, if they are no more necessary. 
Resource closing is handled via the <code>close()</code> method.</li>
</ul>
Query executer implementations can benefit from using 
<api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/query/JRAbstractQueryExecuter.html">JRAbstractQueryExecuter</api> as 
a base. The abstract base provides query parameter processing functionality and other utility methods.
<br/>
<br/>
There are several query languages, related to the data storage type. One can use <code>SQL</code> 
for retrieving data from relational databases, <code>XPath</code> or <code>XQuery</code> for navigating through XML 
elements in a document, <code>HQL</code> when performing queries using hibernate, etc. Depending on the 
query language, at fill time the engine calls a specific query executer class to execute the query, 
retrieve the data and finally create the data source object.
<br/>
Anytime a report query is defined one has to specify the query language using the <code>language</code> attribute 
in the <code>&lt;queryString/&gt;</code> element. If no language is specified, the <code>SQL</code> is considered 
by default, for backward compatibility reasons. Below is defined a query written using the <code>HQL</code> language:
<pre><![CDATA[
  <queryString language="hql">
    <![CDATA[from Address address where city not in ($P{CityFilter}) order by $P!{OrderClause}]] >
  </queryString>]]></pre>
Query executer implementations are produced in query executer factories. To register a query executer 
factory for a query language, you have to define a global property named 
<code>net.sf.jasperreports.query.executer.factory.&lt;language&gt;</code> in the 
<code>/src/default.jasperreports.properties</code> file. The same mechanism can be used to override the 
built-in query executers for a query language, for instance to use a custom query executer for SQL queries. 
<br/>
A query executer factory should implement the <api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/query/JRQueryExecuterFactory.html">JRQueryExecuterFactory</api> 
interface with the following methods:
<ul>
<li><code>public Object[] getBuiltinParameters();</code> - retrieves the built-in parameters associated with the query type.</li>
<li><code>public JRQueryExecuter createQueryExecuter(JRDataset dataset, Map parameters) throws JRException;</code> - creates the 
query executer implementation.</li>
<li><code>public boolean supportsQueryParameterType(String className);</code> - 
decides whether the query executers created by this factory support a query parameter type.</li>
</ul>
Another way to register new query executer factories, without modifying existing application files, is to register them as 
JasperReports extensions. One ore more query executer implementations can be packaged in a 
query executer bundle that can be deployed as a single JAR file. The extension point for query executers 
is represented by the <api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/query/QueryExecuterFactoryBundle.html">QueryExecuterFactoryBundle</api> 
interface.

<b>The Hibernate Query Executer</b>
<br/>
<br/>
A large variety of multi-tier applications rely on database interrogations. In these applications accessing data represents a 
well-delimited layer with specific processing tools, able to create/close connections to a database, to access/modify/retrieve 
data or metadata, to commit/rollback transactions, etc.
<br/>
One of these middle-tier tools dedicated to data access is Hibernate (today: Hibernate 3.3): a collection of correlated projects 
using POJO-style domain models that extend the Object/Relational mapping the initial Hibernate releases relied on.
<br/>
In order to perform queries, Hibernate uses HQL (the <b>H</b>ibernate <b>Q</b>uery <b>L</b>anguage), its specific query language 
with a syntax almost similar to SQL (one can find the HQL basics <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.3/reference/en/html/queryhql.html">here</a>). 
<br/>
So, we have a dedicated tool to interrogate a database, and a related query language. Now it's time to register a new query 
executer factory: 
<br/>
<br/>
&#160;&#160;<code>net.sf.jasperreports.query.executer.factory.hql=net.sf.jasperreports.engine.query.JRHibernateQueryExecuterFactory</code>
<br/>
<br/>
The <api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/query/JRHibernateQueryExecuterFactory.html">JRHibernateQueryExecuterFactory</api> creates 
<api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/query/JRHibernateQueryExecuterFactory.html">JRHibernateQueryExecuterFactory</api> instances to
handle data access through Hibernate APIs. The factory automatically defines a parameter named <code>HIBERNATE_SESSION</code> of type 
<code>org.hibernate.Session</code>, used by the query executer to create the query.
<br/>
HQL queries can embed two types of parameters:
<ul>
<li>Query parameters: embedded using the <code>$P{..}</code> syntax.</li>
<li>Statement substitution parameters: embedded using the <code>$P!{..}</code> syntax.</li>
</ul>
The HQL query execution can be configured via the following properties:
<ul>
<li><code>net.sf.jasperreports.hql.query.run.type</code> - configures how the query result is fetched. It can take the following 
possible values: <code>list</code>, <code>scroll</code>, <code>iterate</code>.</li>
<li><code>net.sf.jasperreports.jdbc.fetch.size</code> - specifies the fetch size.</li>
<li><code>net.sf.jasperreports.hql.clear.cache</code> - flag used to clear the Hibernateâ€™s first-level cache after each page fetching 
when working with a large amount of data.</li>
<li><code>net.sf.jasperreports.hql.query.list.page.size</code> - enables paginated result retrieval and specifies the page size.</li>
<li><code>net.sf.jasperreports.hql.field.mapping.descriptions</code> - instructs the engine to use rather field descriptions than names 
when mapping report fields to values from the Hibernate result.</li>
</ul>
